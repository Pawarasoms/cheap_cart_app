# Cheap Cart app

**Cheap Cart** is a mobile application for easy _price comparison_ of products between 2-4 items. With CheapCart, you no longer have to manually compute prices. My app simplifies the process by allowing users to input the size, quantity, and price of each item, and the app will automatically calculate the cheapest one with the different percentage. 

## Pain point

- variable size of one product

  In today's world, products come in many different sizes, making it challenging for consumers to compare prices and find the best deal.
  People can compute by using this equation : Price per Unit = Price / (size x Quantity). However, this can be time-consuming and tedious if there are multiple sizes of the same product.
  If there are 4 sizes of one product, they have to compute each price/unit (4 times) and find which one is cheapest. 

To address this pain point, some retailers provide price per unit information on their product labels or online product pages, making it easier for consumers to compare prices across different sizes. Another solution could be the use of mobile apps or websites that automatically calculate the price per unit for a given product and display the results in an easy-to-read format.
